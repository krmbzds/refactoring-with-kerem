\section{Plot of Fitness Scores}
The plot for the best performing robots (with default parameters) could be seen below in Figure \ref{fig:fitness}.

\label{fig:fitness}
\end{figure}


\section{Changes in Mutation Probability}
We observe the score stalling after a short period of time in in Figure \ref{fig:fitness-no-mutation} when mutation probability is set to zero.

\subsection{Discussion}
If we compare previous figures, we can see that the robots with zero mutation probability score poorly in their following generations. The comparison could be seen in Figure \ref{fig:fitness-comparison}.

\section{STAY\_PUT Actions}
The average usage of the STAY\_PUT operation for a generation (calculated among 1000 generations) is $50.88$, and for a single robot: $0.2544$. The standard deviation for the number of STAY\_PUT actions is $11.48676$. We can observe decrease in the amount of STAY\_PUT actions through generations as our robot gets clever (or rather, less stupid). The plot for this could be seen below in Figure 4.
